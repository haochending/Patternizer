Patternizer
===========
Project: Patternizer

Enhancement:

1. Everytime a shape is selected, one can double click on it or one of its circular array shapes, then the whole circular array's shapes' color will change randomly to one of the six default color. One can do direct color manipulation by doing this.

2. One can drag the slider at the top of the window to adjust the stroke thickness of the line of the shape to be drawn. The range is set to 1.0f to 5.0f. And the label above will show the current stroke thickness.

3. Every time the mouse is pressed, clicked and dragged there will be a small circle around the mouse point to indicate the area pointing, same as the video shows.
